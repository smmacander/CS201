This file was the result of an investigation I did upon receiving notification of a suspicious powershell script running on a company computer.

Useer's 03/03/2019 Investigation Report: The suspicious powershell script that was ran contained an old exploitation method that involved executing C# commands using Powershell. See (http://www.exploit-monday.com/2011/10/exploiting-powershells-features-not.html). The temp file in question that was presumably the payload that was attempted to be executed, "C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Temp\gobanek", was not found anywhere on the network. The executable that created this process was 'Cofapi.exe' (only found on USER). The executable that created 'Cofapi.exe' was 'timosa.exe', which was created by 'cifofari.exe'. All were only found on USER. 'Cifofari.exe' was created by 'Feet_and_Inches_Calculator_Downloader_2813386736.exe' which was downloaded from Chrome. Windows Defender flagged it as unwanted software on 02/21/2019. Conclusion: The old exploit should be contained by updating the .NET framework and mitigating unwanted software alerts.
